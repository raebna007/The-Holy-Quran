# The-Holy-Quran
This is a capstone project for Misk immersive data science 2021 
Holy Quran word association
This model will take the Holy Quran text in arabic and english and transform it into a clean text using different tools. After that a machine learning model will be used to train a model that when taking an input word it will print the associated word with it.
Word Embedding is the process of taking a words or a phrases from the vocabulary which are mapped to vectors of real numbers.
So, we will use this concept on the holy quran dataset. the idea is to capture as much information as possible
